# I have no code to share yet. I spent my 1 hour getting myself set up for this challenge. I never
# anticipated sharing it (at this point) so publicly, but I figured, it's go big or go home. So yeah.

# For me, NLP is where it's at. I love it (and hate it when I can't get my code to run haha).

# My project that I will be working on is for my thesis. So, you will see my code evolve over time. 
# I am going to be applying it to the realm of accounting. I see so many applications for NLP
# there and I think it will take me into some interesting places.

# If there is a hard way of going about ANY career, that's the way I have done mine. When people 
# look at my resume, my education, and my experience, they usually end up with a very puzzled look
# on their face. And of course, that whole "do it the hard way" thing also applies to my coding. 
# Some of it, I'm pretty good at. Some of it, not so much... I am very proud of all of my career
# experiences and I wouldn't do it any differently, if given the chance. Someone recently asked me
# why I would give up my good paying (meaning my "respectable") industry job to go back to 
# school with my sights set on joining Academia. In the ensuing conversation, it became clear that 
# the people I was talking with saw it as such a waste. I certainly don't see it as giving up 
# anything, let alone it being a waste. We all have our races to run and I have chosen, either
# consciously or unconsciously through my decisions, to run mine differently. Yes, I struggle with
# coding. But, there are many aspects of the greater purpose of the coding where I don't struggle
# but others do. That is where I feel that I can make the biggest contribution at the moment -
# to help others understand and see the bigger pictures, just like they can help me understand and
# see better ways to go about my coding. So even though I am not new new (no, I didin't put in two
# "new" by accident there...) to coding, I am going to use these 100 days to become more proficient
# at it by working on improving my code, asking questions, forging new relationships, and hope that 
# I will feel more comfortable in the community I am in due to my school program, to the point where # I feel that I belong.   

print "I can do this."

# hey, I coulda said "hello world!" instead lol
