# 100 days
Decided I should get on this #100daysofMLCode wagon since Siraj mentioned that there are only 100 days left to the end of the year. I was like "oh wow!" :-) And then reality set in and I was like...ack! Time is running out for so many things. 

So, here I go. Lots to learn, and I know it won't end at the end of the 100th day. But, I will at least be 100 days closer to a much bigger goal. So, here goes. Start date: September 22, 2018.
